# Flight Delay Analysis

A data-driven exploration of flight delay patterns to optimize airline operations and enhance passenger experience.

## Overview

Flight delays cost airlines millions annually while frustrating passengers worldwide. This project analyzes historical flight data to uncover delay patterns, predict delays, and identify key contributing factors. By transforming raw flight records into actionable insights, we help airlines make data-driven decisions to improve on-time performance.

## Key Features

- **Delay Pattern Discovery**: Identify temporal and operational patterns across airlines, routes, and time periods
- **Feature Engineering**: Created analytical columns including time-of-day categories, distance classifications, and in-air time recovery metrics
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Examine delays by carrier, day of week, time of day, and flight distance
- **Data Cleaning Pipeline**: Robust preprocessing to handle missing values and merge multiple data sources

## Dataset

Analysis based on flight records including departure/arrival times, delays, carriers, routes, and aircraft details. Data sourced from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mahoora00135/flights/data).

## Libraries

• Pandas • NumPy • Matplotlib
